.gitignore file has been created to remove the heavyness of the folder node modules.
node_modules folder can be created by any co-worker by just npm install command, so it is redundant here.

so now by 'git status' command we can check that node_modules folder is not there anymore.

Basically a git repository is created in order to track all the changes that have been made so far in a particular project(when there are multiple people working on it).

Command to change the branch of git: git checkout -b <branch_name>
